# App / Product / Extension Ideas

- A chrome extension that detects when you're looking at a config file on GitHub (e.g. `pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.babelrc` etc). Will inject a new section and overlay details about that config file, what options there are etc. Similar to what the github UI does for licenses.
- Website that lets folks submit "best practices" or a "rule" for a technology. Folks can upvote/downvote the rules to give us a list of top rules. You can alsp specifically tag and curate your own list... (useful for a community sourced GraphQL Schema "dos/donts" style guide?
