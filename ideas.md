# App / Product / Extension Ideas

- A chrome extension that detects when you're looking at a config file on GitHub (e.g. `pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.babelrc` etc). Will inject a new section and overlay details about that config file, what options there are etc. Similar to what the github UI does for licenses.
